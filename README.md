# The Power of Metalmatics

## Introduction

From the beginning, mathematics serves as the primary basis for computing, helping man break boundaries that were once insurmountable. Over time, computing has not only helped solve major problems but also began to charm people!

And it was through this existent artistic vein in computing added to the beauty that we already found in mathematical functions that was borned the computer graphics!

## Metal <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Apple_Metal_logo%2C_version_1.png" width=25>

This project will show you, at runtime, the magic of mathematics added to the power of metal, producing a beautiful and mysterious visual.

So that it was possible to accomplish this task nothing better than metal. Performing calculations on the GPU side makes all 3D renderings extremely fast.

In addition to offering us endless possibilities!

## Metalmatics

The relationship between mathematics and Metal can produce really beautiful results!
